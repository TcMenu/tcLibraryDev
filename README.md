# TcMenu and IoAbstraction development and test project

**NOTE that this project is not a fully working solution, it is an example of how to get started with library development in platformIO. It is not maintained.**

This is for developers of tcMenu and IoAbstraction, it allows you to develop source and build both libraries within an IDE using platformIO.

Instructions, the tests within the test folder are platformIO tests that can be run using the regular test job.

To set up:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a lib directory at the top level
3. Clone  IoAbstraction, LiquidCrystalIO and tcMenu into the libs directory
4. Set up platformio.ini with the right parameters for your board.

That's it.
